# USP Political Science Math Camp

This booklet is (for now) just a fork of the [UCSD Political Science Math Camp booklet](https://ucsdpolimathcamp.github.io/MathCamp/21_vector_matrix.html), which is itself adapted from from the [Harvard Gov Prefresher booklet](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/), maintained by [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com). 
The idea is that it will serve as as the text for a future USP Polisci Math Camp. 
We need to translate into Portuguese and adapt it to suit our own needs.
